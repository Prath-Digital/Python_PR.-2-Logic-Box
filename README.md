# Pattern Generator and Number Analyzer

## Project Overview
This Python program, **Pattern Generator and Number Analyzer**, is designed to help students practice control structures, loops (`for` and `while`), the `range()` function, control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`), and nested loops. The program features a menu-driven interface that allows users to generate patterns (e.g., a right-angled triangle) and analyze a range of numbers based on user input.

## Features
1. **Pattern Generator**:
   - Generates a right-angled triangle pattern using nested loops.
   - Prompts the user for the number of rows and validates input.
   - Uses `for` and `while` loops to create the pattern.
2. **Number Analyzer**:
   - Analyzes a user-specified range of numbers.
   - Identifies whether each number is odd or even.
   - Calculates and displays the sum of all numbers in the range.
   - Uses the `range()` function and `for` loops for iteration.
3. **Menu-Driven Interface**:
   - Provides options to generate a pattern, analyze numbers, or exit the program.
   - Displays a welcome message and clear instructions.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Validates user input (e.g., positive row count, valid number range).
   - Provides clear error messages and prompts for re-entry.
5. **Control Statements**:
   - Uses `break` to handle invalid inputs, `continue` to skip specific cases, and `pass` as a placeholder for future extensions.

## Assumptions
- The user will input integers for the number of rows and number range.
- The program supports only a right-angled triangle pattern, as specified.
- The `pass` statement is used as a placeholder in the number analyzer for potential future extensions (e.g., additional checks).
- Invalid inputs (e.g., non-positive row counts or invalid ranges) will prompt the user to retry.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-link>`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
3. **Running the Program**:
   - Run the Python script: `python pattern_generator.py`
   - Follow the on-screen menu to select options and provide inputs.
4. **Example Interaction**:
   ```
   Welcome to the Pattern Generator and Number Analyzer!
   Select an option:
   1. Generate a Pattern
   2. Analyze a Range of Numbers
   3. Exit
   Enter your choice: 1
   Enter the number of rows for the pattern: 5
   Pattern:
   *
   * *
   * * *
   * * * *
   * * * * *
   Enter your choice: 2
   Enter the start of the range: 10
   Enter the end of the range: 15
   Number 10 is Even
   Number 11 is Odd
   Number 12 is Even
   Number 13 is Odd
   Number 14 is Even
   Number 15 is Odd
   Sum of all numbers from 10 to 15 is: 75
   Enter your choice: 3
   Exiting the program. Goodbye!
   ```

## File Structure
- `pattern_generator.py`: The main Python script containing the program logic.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Dependencies
- No external libraries are required; the program uses Python's standard library.

## Notes
- The program is designed to be simple and educational, focusing on fundamental programming concepts.
- The `pass` statement is included in the number analyzer as a placeholder for potential future checks (e.g., prime numbers).
- Input validation ensures robust handling of user errors.

## Submission
The project is hosted on GitHub at: `<repository-link>`. Ensure all files are included and the repository is public or accessible to the instructor.
